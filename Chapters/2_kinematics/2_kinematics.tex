\section{Equations for uniformly accelerated motion}
\begin{eqnarray}
   v = u + at \\
   s = \frac{1}{2} (u+v) t \\
   s = ut + \frac{1}{2} at^2 \\
   v^2 = u^2 + 2as

\section{kinematics of free fall and the effect of air resistance}
objects in the uniform gravitational field of earth undergo uniformly accelerated motion downwards, and experience a constant acceleration with magnitude
\[
   g = 9.81ms^{-2}
\]


Objects experience air resistance, whose magnitude is proportional to velocity and whose direction is opposite to velocity
\begin{itemize}
   \item on an object's way up, it experiences air resistance in the direction of downward acceleration due to gravity, hence \[
   a_{up} > g
   \]
   \item on its way down, it experiences air resistance opposite gravity, hence \[
         a_{down} < g
   \]
   
\end{itemize}
